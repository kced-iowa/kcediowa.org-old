They were successful in bringing Kingsbury Homes to Sigourney, which brought a much-needed economic boost in the form of jobs in the plant, and in construction jobs as many homes were constructed in the Sigourney area during the next 12 to 15 years."

        data: "After Kingsbury closed, the group came very close to attracting Rudy Farm Foods, a division of Sara Lee, to build a meat processing plant at the Kingsbury site.  Although they were not successful, that search led to Louis Rich purchasing the Rawhide Ranch Meats plant east of town, West Liberty Foods; currently Beef Slaughtering Plant/Kenton Walker. "

        data: "In the mid 1980's, SADC attracted Bender Foundry Products to one of the buildings at the Kingsbury site.  When Bender outgrew the site and was looking at possibly location elsewhere, the SADC board leadership at that time, Duane Atwood, Jack Walker and Mike Welter, put together a campaign to buy land for an industrial park in Sigourney.  In a period of 2 weeks, SADC raised $112,000 in private funds (donations, not loans) to purchase the land east of Expo for the park, and Bender was later moved to that site.  SADC then worked with Pathfinders RC&D and the City’s engineers to get over a million dollars in grants to build streets, sewer, and water lines in the park. (This also resulted in getting sewer service to Expo and getting them off of a septic tank.)  The City was able to get much-needed sewer and water improvements for a very small investment of match money."

These grants totaled millions of dollars, and provided a much-needed water main loop around the east side of Sigourney, in addition to the new wells and treatment facility."

SADC leadership met with them and put together a group of local contractors with a promise to build a building to their specifications, within a short time period if they would locate here.  The building was completed on time during one of the worst Iowa winters anyone could remember, and Duro-Last kept their promise and developed their Midwest operation here."

Because most industrial prospects insist on keeping their inquiries confidential, much of what SADC does, by definition, then becomes confidential.  Many times, revealing that an industry is thinking of expanding or moving could cause labor problems, or give a competitor an advantage, so such information must be kept confidential until the industry is ready to announce it.
